## RGB led example
In this example I am using a RGB led and a colision sensor(because I don't have a button now).
Take into account the for the RGB led that I am using for input values True means False and False means True so they are opposite.
And also the collision sensor sends data all the time and the only case when is not sends data is when is triggered.

On RGB led you have 4 pins: 3 of them are for RGB and one of them is for power(vcc)

On colision sensor you have 3 pins: vcc means the power pin, the GND is ground pin and OUT is the output pin.
