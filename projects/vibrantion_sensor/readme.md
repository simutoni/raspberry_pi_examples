## Vibration sensor example
In this example I am using a usb camera and a vibration sensor. When the vibration sensor is triggered the camera is going to take and save an image.

On vibration sensor you have 3 pins:
vcc means the power pin, the second one in the middle is ground pin and DO is the output pin.
